# Snor OS 
A x86 32 Bit Kernel from Scratch. My Favorite pokemon is snorlax, so I wanted to write a operating system from scratch centered around him. Thats about it, It's single tasking and monolothic for now. 


This entire operating system has been written with theme "victory over my past self", youll prob see this in various random comments that were hells that i debugged.
